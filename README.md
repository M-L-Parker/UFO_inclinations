# UFO_inclinations
### Code for comparing the velocities of ultra-fast outflows with accretion disk inclinations

Data and code used to produce the plots in Parker et al. (in prep)

Start with the Jupyter notebooks for the [correlation analysis](https://github.com/M-L-Parker/UFO_inclinations/blob/master/Correlation_Analysis.ipynb) and [toy models](https://github.com/M-L-Parker/UFO_inclinations/blob/master/Wind%20geometries.ipynb)

The complete list of outflows and reflection measurements used is contained in data.tsv.

A note of caution: This study is intended as proof of concept. The data are very biased, and likely to contain large systematic errors. The models we examine are extremely simple. Handle with care.
